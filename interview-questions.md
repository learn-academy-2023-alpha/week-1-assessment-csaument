# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is an open source set of rules and conventions that allows users to collaborate on projects using shared repositories. git allows each agent to work on local branches of repositories, package additions and subtractions, and push that package of changes to a host where each branch can be compared and merged. GitHub is a free to use implementation of the git standard and the largest repository of code.

Researched answer: Git is a version-control system that manages source code history. GitHub provodies cloud-based hosting of code respositories, allowing large teams to collaborate on a project. The source code is protected through rules 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: <, >, <=, >=, !, !=, ==, and === provide different ways of operating on Boolean values or comparing numbers to return a Boolean value.

Researched answer: Additionally, || and &&

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a location while a value is the object at that location. In Javascript, Strings and Arrays are common Objects that use indexed values to organize data. By convention, index values begin at 0.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:

In Javascript, Arrays and Strings share many attributes and functions while providing some distinct differences in their operation. Both can be broken into component parts using index notation (eg. [0]), which allows custom functions to walk through and process their values. Strings and Arrays both implement an attribute for length and functions for concatenation. Strings specifically implement functions for modifying the case of their characters while Arrays specifically implement functions for reversing, pushing, popping, or shifting their objects.

There is additionally functionality that allows a String to .split("") into an Array of characters or to have an Array of characters .join("") into a String. Strings are potentially significantly more efficient with memory allocation and garbage collection, because Arrays can include any datatype as an object, including other Arrays.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:

Pair programming is a technique that divides the functions of coding between a driver and a navigator. The driver writes the lines of code within a text editor while the navigator provides guidance and direction. By working in parallel, the pair shares the mental burden of coding, can collectively share ideas, and catch mistakes and errors more rapidly. These improvements develop higher quality code on first pass. Pair coding is also an effective technique for learning how to code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions implement other functions in their operation. This could be through recursive calls of the same function or through encapsulation through abstraction. Recursion either performs a given function until reaching a desired end condition or calls itself with a smaller subset of the input. Abstraction takes complicated, multi-step functions and creates component functions that perform various pieces.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing framework that provides a broad global state for running javascript applications.

3. Objects: Objects are containers for values. They provide predictable interaction by defining the same type of values that should be expected for each instance, while allowing unique interaction based upon specific value of each property.

4. Method: Methods are functions included as parameters of an object. Within javascript, they are defined within the class. They provide the ability to access or change the object based upon predictable/defined procedures.

5. Classes: Classes are typically used in object-oriented programming, although also many scripting languages implement forms of classes. Classes provide a reuseable template for objects that can maintain a state of values, provide interaction via both accessor and mutator methods, and otherwise provide consistent performance. They also provide security of their data through encapsulation.
